## Instructions:
Build a React Native App where the user of the app will be able to
take pictures using the camera and then view the photos on the app.

## App features will include:
- [x] Clicking on the Camera button opens the Camera module.
- [x] The pictures taken from the camera are shown on the app like an image
Gallery.
- [x] A click on a specific image on the list shows the image on a modal.
- [x] The modal can be closed with a ‘X’ button at the top right or anywhere else
on the screen besides the modal.
- [x] The Image gallery can show 4 pictures at a time, so add a pagination at the
bottom.
- [x] The pagination should contain the number of pages available and both ‘prev’
and ‘next’ buttons.
- [x] Adding animation on the page switch is a bonus.
## Things to keep in mind:
* You can either use Expo or React Native CLI for this project.
* Besides the Camera module, do not use any other libraries for the rest of the
features.
* Use React Hooks for the project.
* Keep code clean and simple
## Submission:
* Share the github repo for the code.
* Share the apk build for the code.
